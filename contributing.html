    <h2>Contact us</h2>
    <p>The best way to contact us is to join <a href="irc://irc.spotchat.org/linuxmint-dev">#linuxmint-dev</a> on irc.spotchat.org.</p>

    <p>As a general rule of thumb, don't attempt to start a conversation with pointless statements. If you just say "hello" and shut up, you will get ignored. If you ask if you could speak/ask a question, you will get ignored. If you ask "anyone here?", you won't get ignored. Three different people will answer "no" in three different ways.</p>

    <p>Also, wait for people to answer. It might take hours, but eventually someone will reply. Don't quit after 15 minutes. Or 1 hour. Or 3 hours. Wait as long as you can. It doesn't hurt to leave the chat window open. Remember everyone is in a different timezone and you might be coming at a time where everyone is asleep.</p>

    <p>This is also why you should say something meaningful, not "hi". If what you say actually has some content, someone will see it and reply sooner or later, even if decades have past. If you say "hi" an hour ago, replying is very awkward.</p>

    <p>I'll reiterate. Never, <em>ever</em>, say "I have a problem", or "Hello", and wait for someone to reply before continuing. It will never happen. Just keep speaking until you have delivered the full message you wanted to deliver. THEN someone will reply and help you.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading and (hopefully) making my life on the IRC less miserable.</p>

    <h2>Translations</h2>
    <p>Translations are done on <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/linuxmint/latest/+templates">Launchpad</a>. This includes both Cinnamon and Linux Mint translations. Help is particularly needed near release time since a lot of new words need to be translated for newer versions of Cinnamon and Mint tools.</p>

    <p>You can also join a <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/linux-mint">Linux Mint translation team</a> if you wish.</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>Mint and Cinnamon projects are found on <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/">GitHub</a>. The languages used are mainly C, Javascript and Python. It is a good idea to talk to us on the IRC before starting any coding work. Do not email developers directly. Everything shall be discussed on the IRC (see above for how not to get ignored on the IRC. If you are ignored, you are doing it wrong).</p>
