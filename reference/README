The build.sh script builds the cinnamon documentation and puts them in the
right place. If you simply run ./build.sh, the documentation for Cinnamon git
will be built. You can build specific versions with ./build.sh <version>, eg.
./build.sh 2.6. Do not supply the point version number, ie. not 2.6.0.

When building, make sure you do not have mutter gtk-docs installed on your
system, or else gtk-doc will get confused and link everything to mutter instead
of muffin.

The index.html of this file has to be manually updated when there is a new
version coming out. For example, you will have to add an entry for 2.8 when it
comes out. This is only done twice a year when releases are made. Don't
complain. If you don't like it, fix it.
